# Difference Between ArrayList and LinkedList
| Difference | ArrayList | LinkedList |
|---------|---------|----------|
| Internal Implementation      | **dynamic array** to store its elements      | **Doubly Linked List** to store its elements.       |
|Manipulation| slow as array manipulation is slower.|  faster being node based as not much bit shifting required.|
|Implementation|implements only **List**.|implements **List** as well as **Queue**. |
|Access|ArrayList is faster in **storing** and **accessing data**.|LinkedList is faster in **manipulation of data**.|


**Dynamic Array**: The dynamic array is a **variable size list** data structure. It grows automatically when we try to insert an element if there is no more space left for the new element. It allows us to add and remove elements. It allocates memory at run time using the heap. It can change its size during run time.
